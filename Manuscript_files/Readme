   - Public scRNA-Seq datasets: Acral and Cutaneous Melanoma from the study ( PRJNA862451), PBMCs from Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) (SRR7722937), head and neck cancer patients (SRR13418965, SRR13419137, SRR13419168) and 5’- sequencing datasets of tissue biopsies from patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
